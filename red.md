# Introduction

In this project we will build a MySQL database using the Internet Movie Database
(IMDb) dataset. The dataset consists of 7 compressed tab-separated-value
(\*.tsv) files, which are explained and available for download from
[here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). The data is refreshed daily, although
the data used in this project was obtained on **29/11/2019**.


The purpose of this project is to do the following:

- Learn about and use the database management system MySQL.

- Learn the essentials of database design, e.g., Entity-Relationship diagrams,
logical schema, and database normalisation.

- Practice database querying by posing basic and more advanced queries using
MySQL directly and also indirectly using python.

- Visualise IMDb data using python.

The tangible steps we will take in this project are:

- Understand the data in the IMDb dataset.

- Design a relational database and store the IMDb data in it.

  - Model the database using an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.
  - Perform normalisation and restructure the IMDb data using python.
  - Create MySQL database.
  - Load data into the database.
  - Add primary and foreign key constraints.
  - Create database indexes.

- Ask questions of the IMDb data, so as to practice simple and more advanced SQL
queries.

- Perform further exploration and also visualisation of the data using python.

- Throughout we will adhere to SQL style conventions, e.g., please see SQL Style
guide <https://www.sqlstyle.guide/>. In particular, underscores will be used in
attribute names rather than camel case, which is used in the IMDb data files.


## Dataset details

Each dataset is contained in a gzipped tab-separated-values (TSV) formatted
file in the UTF-8 character set. The first line in each file contains headers
that describe what is in each column. A "\\N" is used to denote that a
particular field is missing or has a NULL value for that title or name. It
should be noted that the data available for download from the IMDb website is
not the full dataset, but it will suffice for our purposes. The available IMDb
data files are as follows:

### name.basics.tsv.gz

Contains the following information for names:

  - nconst (string) - alphanumeric unique identifier of the name/person.
  - primaryName (string)– name by which the person is most often credited.
  - birthYear – in YYYY format.
  - deathYear – in YYYY format if applicable, else "\\N".
  - primaryProfession (array of strings) – the top-3 professions of the person.
  - knownForTitles (array of tconsts) – titles the person is known for.

### title.basics.tsv.gz

Contains the following information for titles:

  - tconst (string) - alphanumeric unique identifier of the title.
  - titleType (string) – the type/format of the title (e.g. movie, short,
    tvseries, tvepisode, video, etc).
  - primaryTitle (string) – the more popular title / the title used by the
  filmmakers on promotional materials at the point of release.
  - originalTitle (string) - original title, in the original language.
  - isAdult (boolean) - 0: non-adult title; 1: adult title.
  - startYear (YYYY) – represents the release year of a title. In the case of TV
  Series, it is the series start year.
  - endYear (YYYY) – TV Series end year. "\\N" for all other title types.
  - runtimeMinutes – primary runtime of the title, in minutes.
  - genres (string array) – includes up to three genres associated with the
  title.


### title.akas.tsv.gz

Contains the following information for titles:

  - titleId (string) - a tconst which is an alphanumeric unique identifier of
  the title.
  - ordering (integer) – a number to uniquely identify rows for a given titleId.
  - title (string) – the localised title.
  - region (string) - the region for this version of the title.
  - language (string) - the language of the title.
  - types (array) - Enumerated set of attributes for this alternative title. One
  or more of the following: "alternative", "dvd", "festival", "tv", "video",
  "working", "original", "imdbDisplay". New values may be added in the future
  without warning.
  **Please note that types is said to be an array. In the data we have this
  appears to not be true. There appears to be only one string for each pair of
  titleId and ordering values. Also, there are many NULL (\\N) values in this
  field (~95%).**

  - attributes (array) - Additional terms to describe this alternative title,
  not enumerated.
  **Please note that attributes is said to be an array. In the data we have this
  appears to not be true. There appears to be only one string for each pair of
  titleId and ordering values. There are many NULL (\\N) values in this field
  (~99%).**

  - isOriginalTitle (boolean) – 0: not original title; 1: original title.


### title.crew.tsv.gz

### IMDb dataset license details

Subsets of IMDb data are available for access to customers for personal and
non-commercial use. You can hold local copies of this data, and it is subject to
our terms and conditions. Please refer to the
[Non-Commercial Licensing](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/general-information/can-i-use-imdb-data-in-my-software/G5JTRESSHJBBHTGX?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=3aefe545-f8d3-4562-976a-e5eb47d1bb18&pf_rd_r=0J8FC9NDYKWB18MEW883&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_t=60601&pf_rd_i=interfaces&ref_=fea_mn_lk1#) and [copyright/license](https://www.imdb.com/conditions?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=3aefe545-f8d3-4562-976a-e5eb47d1bb18&pf_rd_r=0J8FC9NDYKWB18MEW883&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_t=60601&pf_rd_i=interfaces&ref_=fea_mn_lk2) and verify compliance.

### A few WARNINGs about the IMDb dataset

The IMDb data base contains details of adult titles. If this is likely to offend
you or others that see your work, then you can filter these titles out by using
the field isAdult in title.basics.tsv.gz.

The IMDb dataset is a noisy dataset. In particular, there are some issues with
missing data which affected how we added constraints to the database. These are
discussed in the note [IMDb_data_issues.md](IMDb_data_issues.md). Of course,
missing data could be obtained by scraping the IMDb but this is beyond the scope
of the project.

## Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram

The IMDb data as provided is not normalised. We first design an entity-relationship diagram for our IMDb relational database. This is shown below.  

![IMDb ER diagram.](images/db_design/imdb-er-diagram.png)

## Logical schema

We then normalise our ER diagram and obtain the logical schema illustrated below. Note the following:

- New tables were created for multi-valued attributes, such as Title_genres.

- We pulled the rating information attributes from the Titles entity, because many titles didn't have a rating. If we were to store them in the Titles table, then we would have stored many NULL values. Instead we decided to separate this information, by putting it into the table Title_ratings.

![IMDb logical schema diagram.](images/db_design/imdb-logical-schema.png)

## Prepare the IMDb data and build the IMDb database

### 1) Preprocess the IMDb dataset  

The IMDb data is preprocessed using python. The script  `imdb_converter.py`
reads in the 7 data files, cleans and normalises the IMDb data. After which, the
desired set of tables are output as tab-separate-value (tsv) files.

![Terminal screenshot imdb_converter.py](images/terminal_screenshots/Terminal_screenshot-imdb_converter.png)

### 2) Build MySQL database

The sequence of steps to build the database are as follows:

1. Open MySQL in terminal:

```bash
$ mysql -u root -p --local-infile
```

The SQL commands to build the database described above by the ER diagram and
logical schema are contained in 4 `*.sql scripts`:

- imdb-create-tables.sql
- imdb-load-data.sql
- imdb-add-constraints.sql
- imdb-index-tables.sql

2. Create IMDb data base in MySQL:

```sqlmysql  
mysql> SOURCE /Users/lappy/Git_repos_mine/MySQL_IMDb_Project/imdb-create-tables.sql
```

3. Load data using this script in MySQL:
```sqlmysql
mysql> SOURCE /Users/lappy/Git_repos_mine/MySQL_IMDb_Project/imdb-load-data.sql
```

4. Add constraints to the IMDb database in MySQL
```sqlmysql
mysql> SOURCE /Users/lappy/Git_repos_mine/MySQL_IMDb_Project/imdb-add-constraints.sql
```

5. Add indexes to the IMDb database in MySQL
```sqlmysql
mysql> SOURCE /Users/lappy/Git_repos_mine/MySQL_IMDb_Project/imdb-index-tables.sql
```

![Terminal screenshot of running imdb-index-tables.sql in MySQL](images/terminal_screenshots/MySQL-index-tables.png)

## SQL Queries using MySQL

After creating and loading data into the database, we can now pose queries to
it. In the file `SQL_Queries_1.sql` we consider many questions and answer them
by querying the IMDb database. This section is an on going piece of work. We
intend to add more questions and queries to the repository as we practice SQL.

For each query in the file `SQL_Queries_1.sql` we create a view by

```sqlmysql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Q1(column_1,column_2)
AS
...
;
```

The result of the query which is stored in the view can be seen by
```sqlmysql
SELECT * FROM Q1;
```

To delete the view
```sqlmysql
DROP VIEW Q1;
```

The database is quite large, so for illustration purposes we will quite often
limit ourselves to the first few entries only.

### Example queries

We will consider a few queries for illustration purposes.

- Query 9: Who are the actors who played James Bond in a movie? How many times
did they play the role of James Bond?

```sqlmysql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Q9(name_id,name_,number_of_films)
AS SELECT N.name_id, N.name_, COUNT(*) AS number_of_films
FROM Names_ AS N, Had_role AS H, Titles AS T
WHERE H.role_ LIKE 'James Bond'
AND T.title_type LIKE 'movie'
AND T.title_id = H.title_id
AND N.name_id = H.name_id
GROUP BY N.name_id;
```
To see the results of this query:

```sqlmysql
SELECT * FROM Q9;
```

![MySQL Query 9.](images/terminal_screenshots/MySQL-Query9.png)


- Query 10: How many actors played James Bond?

```sqlmysql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Q10(number_of_JB_actors)
AS SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name_id) AS number_of_JB_actors
FROM Q9;
```

To see the results of this query:
```sqlmysql
SELECT * FROM Q10;
```
![MySQL Query 10.](images/terminal_screenshots/MySQL-Query10.png)

- Query 11: I don't recognise some of these names lets look at them more closely

```sqlmysql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Q11(name_,title_id,primary_title,start_year)
AS SELECT Q9.name_, T.title_id, T.primary_title, T.start_year
FROM Q9, Titles AS T, Had_role AS H
WHERE Q9.name_id = H.name_id
AND H.role_ LIKE 'James Bond'
AND T.title_id = H.title_id
AND T.title_type LIKE 'movie'
ORDER BY T.start_year DESC;
```

To see the results of this query:
```sqlmysql
SELECT * FROM Q11;
```
![MySQL Query 11.](images/terminal_screenshots/MySQL-Query11.png)

Clearly, a few of these movies contain the character James Bond, but are not the
James Bond movies we have in mind. In particular, the appearance of the movie
`Deadly Hands of Kung Fu` is quite interesting as it looks to be a 1970's kung
fu flick. Its IMDb page can be found
[here](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165362/). From this page we quote its
synopsis:


>"It's one of the "Bruceploitation" films that were made to cash in on Bruce Lee after his death. The story follows Bruce Lee after he dies and ends up in Hell. Once there, he does the logical thing and opens a gym. After fending off the advances of the King Of Hell's naked wives, he discovers that the most evil people in Hell are attempting a takeover, so Bruce sets out to stop it. As if it wasn't weird enough, the evil people are: Zatoichi (the blind swordsman hero of Japanese film), **James Bond**, The Godfather, The Exorcist, Emmanuelle (the "heroine" of many European softcore porn films), Dracula, and, of course, Clint Eastwood (played by a Chinese guy). Aiding Bruce is The One-Armed Swordsman (hero of kung-fu films), Kain from the U.S. tv series, Kung-Fu (actually played by a Chinese guy this time), and Popeye the Sailor Man! Yes, Popeye the Sailor Man. He eats spinach and helps Bruce fight some mummies."

**WOW!!!** I certainly was not expecting that, I need to see this movie! In the
script `imdb_scraper.py` we provide a couple of functions that can be used to
extract the url of a movie poster on its IMDb webpage using its `title_id`.

![Poster url for Deadly Hands of Kung Fu.](images/terminal_screenshots/Terminal_screenshot-imdb_scraper.png)

![Poster for Deadly Hands of Kung Fu.](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk0NTE1MDA1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTIxMDAxNDE@._V1_UY268_CR8,0,182,268_AL_.jpg)


The functions used to scrape the movie poster url made use of BeautifulSoup and
urllib.request.


## SQL Queries using python and data visualisation



In the notebook `MySQL_IMDb_visualisation.ipynb` we query the IMDb database to
explore and visualise the IMDb dataset using pandas and matplotlib.
This notebook is by no means a thorough exploration of the IMDb dataset. Its
purpose is to practice querying a database using python, then to process and
visualise the retrieved data with the pandas package. In particular, we consider
the following questions:

- What are the average ratings for the TV show 'The X-files'?
- What genres are there?
- How many movies are there in each genre?
- How many movies are made in each genre each year?
- How do the average ages of leading actors and actresses compare in each genre?
- What is a typical runtime for movies in each genre?

This section is also an ongoing piece of work, which will be added to in the
future.

As a sample of the kind of querying and visualisation performed in this notebook
we show a few of the created figures:

![Average ratings of episodes of the X-Files.](images/plots/The_X-Files_ratings.png)

![Number of movies in the database in each genre.](images/plots/Genre_movie_count.png)

![Number of movies per year in each genre.](images/plots/Genre_movie_count_vs_year.png)
